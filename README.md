# Quadratic Equations Solver

The script tests different cases of discriminant of quadratic equation depending on input a, b
c coefficients (a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0) and compare the results in the tests.py file.

# How to Use

Input in the tests.py file needed a, b, c coefficients and expected result and launch the file.

# How to Launch Tests

```bash
python tests.py
```

# Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - [DEVMAN.org](https://devman.org)
